# Criteria
- *Compression Ratio (CR)*: compressed file size / original uncompressed file size (lower the better)
- *Spectrogram Error*: direct difference between power spectrograms (lower the better)
- *Weighted Spectrogram Error*: direct difference between A-weighted power spectrograms (lower the better)
- *Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)*: noise is calculated from signal power difference (higher the better)
- *Weighted SNR*: noise is calculated from A-weighted signal power difference (higher the better)
